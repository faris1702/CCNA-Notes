# CCNA-Notes
I have passed the 200-301 CCNA v1.1 and would like to share the notes that I created when studying for it. It is entirely based on Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA course on youtube which can be viewed for free. I hope these notes can help you in your studies for the CCNA exam. <br>

## Advice to those taking CCNA

<b>1) Make sure the fundamental knowledge is easy for you to explain </b><br>
You need to have a very good understanding of how each of the topics mentioned in the CCNA exam topics. You should have a good understanding if you can answer the questions in my notes.

<b>2) Purchase Boson ExSim if possible </b><br>
There are some additional content in the exams that are extremely beneficial which is not in JITL videos. I highly recommend purchasing it if you can afford it. You should also try to do the exams only after going through all of the JITL videos. Try to read and understand the questions you got wrong or questions that you are doubtful. Their explanations are really good to fully understand the concept.<br><br>

<b>3) Be good at subnetting </b><br>
Subnetting is very important especially during the exam. Subnetting questions are free marks and can save you a lot of time which can be spent on questions that are more difficult. Below are some links that you can use to practice subnetting.<br>

<b>4) Be good at labbing </b><br>
The labs provided by JITL is sufficient enough for the CCNA. Do the labs over and over again to make it muscle memory. Make sure you know how to configure everything mentioned in the CCNA course topics (those that mention 'configure') . During the exam, take your time to fully understand the questions. The '?' command will output a lot more 
possible commands than in Packet Tracer. <br><br>

<b>5) Look for wrong answers </b><br>
There might be some questions where you might feel overwhelmed. Calm down at look at the possible answers and see which ones are obviously wrong. This will give you an easier time to look for the correct answer.<br><br>

<b>6) Don't lose hope during the exam</b><br>
During my exam, it was quite different than what I was expecting. I was very uncertain about my labs and there were some questions that I did not know and by the time the exam finished, I was uncertain (50-50) whether I was going to pass or not. Alhamdulillah, I managed to pass at the end.
